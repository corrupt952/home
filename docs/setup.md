# Set up my home devices

## Network architecture

I have set up a home network using VLANs to separate personal and business subnets.  
Although not shown in the figure, communication is not allowed between each subnet.

### Requirements

Before starting work, it is necessary to prepare in advance.

- Install [aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/)
- Install [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

### 1. Install Ubuntu to devices

Set up using CD, DVD, or USB installation media.  
Set up with only minimal configuration, and set up SSH public keys to be obtained from GitHub.

### 2. Configure static IP

I want to fix the IP address before running Ansible, so set up `netplan`.

1. Set up `/etc/netplan/99-config.yaml`.

    ```yaml
    # /etc/netplan/99-config.yaml
    network:
      version: 2
      ethernets:
        eno1:
          dhcp4: no
          dhcp6: no
          routes:
          - to: default
            via: 192.168.x.1
          # Configure Nameservers
          nameservers:
            addresses: [1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1]
          # Configure static IP
          addresses:
          - 192.168.x.y/24
          - 192.168.x.z/24
    ```

1. Apply a netplan configuration

    ```sh
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

### 3. Run playbooks

Run `ansible-playbook` to set up each device.

1. Move to `ansible` directory

    ```
    cd ansible
    ```

1. Download `hosts` from 1Password

    ```yaml
    # e.g. hosts
    [control-plane]
    192.168.x.y

    [control-plane:vars]
    ansible_ssh_user=john
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/github

    [workers]
    192.168.x.z

    [workers:vars]
    ansible_ssh_user=john
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/github
    ```

1. Dry-run ansible-playbook

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook site.yaml -i hosts -K --check
    ```

1. Run ansible-playbook

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook site.yaml -i hosts -K
    ```

### 4. Install Argo CD
